# Datatypes in JavaScript. 😙

[Home](../README.md) / Datatypes in JavaScript. 😙

---

There are primarily two types of datatypes in JavaScript:

➡ [Primitives 💫](#primitives-)  
➡ [Objects ☯](#objects-)

---

## Primitives 💫

The lowest level building blocks in JavaScript are primitives, which include: undefined, null, string, number, bigint, boolean, and symbol. All primitives are immutable.

```js
> typeof  5; // number
> typeof "Mon" // string
> typeof null // null
> typeof true // boolean
```

## Objects ☯

Anything that is not a primitive is an Object, or a descendant of it. Objects are collections of key/value pairs and used as the building block for more complex data structures.

```js
typeof {}; // object
typeof []; // object
typeof function () {}; // function (which inherits from object)
```

JavaScript provides various different data types:

| Data Types  | Examples                                                              |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `undefined` | A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type `undefined`. |
| `null`      | No value.                                                             |
| `string`    | `'a', 'aa', 'aaa', 'Hello!'`                                          |
| `number`    | `-5, 2, 0.1`                                                          |
| `boolean`   | `true, false`                                                         |
| `object`    | A collection of properties, with key and value pair.                  |
| `symbol`    | Represents a unique identifier.                                       |
| `array`     | A group of common type of values.                                     |

Lets recapitulate 📝:

➡ There are primarily two types of datatypes in JavaScript: Primitives and Objects. Anything which is not a primitive datatype is an Object.
