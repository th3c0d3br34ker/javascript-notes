# Datatypes in JavaScript. 😙

[Home](..\README.md) / Datatypes in JavaScript.

---

There are primarily two types of datatypes in JavaScript:

➡ [Primitives 💫](#primitives-)  
➡ [Objects ☯](#objects-)

---

## Primitives 💫

The lowest level building blocks in JavaScript are primitives, which include: undefined, null, string, number, bigint, boolean, and symbol. All primitives are immutable.

```js
> typeof  5; // number
> typeof "Mon" // string
> typeof null // null
> typeof true // boolean
```

## Objects ☯ 

Anything that is not a primitive is an Object, or a descendant of it. Objects are collections of key/value pairs and used as the building block for more complex data structures.

```js
typeof {}; // object
typeof []; // object
typeof function () {}; // function (which inherits from object)
```
