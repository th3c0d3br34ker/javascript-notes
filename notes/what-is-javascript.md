JavaScript is a synchronous, single-threaded language.

## History 🌍

JavaScript is a scripting language written by Brendan Eich in 1995 for the Netscape Navigator browser under the working name of **“Mocha”**. After being renamed to **“JavaScript”**, it was standardized by [ECMA International](http://www.ecma-international.org/) as ECMA-262 or [ECMAScript](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm) in 1997. The authoritative group of people/organizations in charge of the standard is known as TC-39.

Over the next 25 years, it would see a variety of highs and lows. The most notable releases include

➡ ES1 1997.  
➡ ES2 1998.  
➡ ES3 1999. The longest-standing version of early JS.
➡ ES4 Never finalized.  
➡ ES5 2009. Added JSON, strict mode, functional array methods, and more.  
➡ ES6 2015. Added classes, promises, arrow functions, let/const, and much more.  
➡ ES7, ES8, ES9, ESNext. Modern updates are now being released annually.
