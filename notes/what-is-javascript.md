JavaScript is a synchronous, single-threaded language.
```

JavaScript is scripting language written by **Brendan Eich** in 1995 for the Netscape Navigator browser under the working name of “Mocha”. After being renamed to “JavaScript”, it was standardized by ECMA International as ECMA-262, or ECMAScript in 1997. The authoritative group of people/orgs in charge of the standard is known as TC-39.

Over the next 25 years, it would see a variety of highs and lows. The most notable releases include

➡ ES1 1997.  
➡ ES2 1998.  
➡ ES3 1999. The longest standing version of early JS.  
➡ ES4 Never finalized.  
➡ ES5 2009. Added JSON, strict mode, functional array methods, and more.  
➡ ES6 2015. Added classes, promises, arrow functions, let/const, and much more.  
➡ ES7, ES8, ES9, ESNext. Modern updates now being released annually.
